# Data-Science-in-Cybersecurity
•	Build a model that predicts the attacks liken DOS, Fuzzers, Reconnaissance, Exploits, worms and others in a given set of Network Data.
•	Pre-processed data by removing special characters, handling missing data and giving special attention to feature selection
•	Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost and SVM to predict the probability of the attacks achieving 98% accuracy.
